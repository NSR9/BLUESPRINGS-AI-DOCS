## üéØ Project Overview

Welcome to your final year capstone project! This is not just another academic assignment - it's your opportunity to build a **production-ready, enterprise-grade AI chatbot** that demonstrates your full-stack development capabilities. You will be creating a ChatGPT-style application that showcases modern software engineering practices, AI integration, and scalable architecture.

### üöÄ What You'll Build

A sophisticated, multi-provider AI chatbot application with:
- **Real-time streaming responses** (like ChatGPT's live typing effect)
- **Multi-AI provider support** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)
- **Professional-grade user interface** with session management
- **Database persistence** and user authentication
- **Production-ready deployment** capabilities

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Requirements

### Frontend Technology Stack
- **Framework:** React.js (JavaScript only - no TypeScript allowed)
- **State Management:** Redux OR Thesys.dev (choose one)
- **Styling:** CSS3 with modern design principles
- **UI Components:** Custom-built components (no UI libraries like Material-UI, Ant Design)
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first design approach

### Backend Technology Stack
- **Option 1:** FastAPI (Python 3.8+) with async/await support
- **Option 2:** Express.js (Node.js 16+) with ES6+ features
- **API Design:** RESTful API with proper HTTP status codes
- **Authentication:** JWT-based session management
- **Validation:** Request/response validation with proper error handling

### Database Requirements
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL OR MongoDB OR MySQL
- **Connection Pooling:** Implement connection pooling for scalability
- **Data Models:** Proper normalization and relationship design
- **Migrations:** Database schema versioning and migration scripts

### Streaming Technology
- **Protocol:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) with `text/event-stream` MIME type
- **Implementation:** Real-time token-by-token streaming (not batch responses)
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback for connection failures
- **Performance:** Optimized for low-latency response delivery
